    <h2>My Assessment</h2> <!--Hey Thomas!-->
    <p>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. 
Clarity is not the same as simplicity . Often, simple things are clear 
if the message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message 
is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a 
necessarily large amount of data. <img alt="content-image" src="../pre-assessment/assets/img/content-image2.jpg"></p>
    <p class="alert">This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective 
organization and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless 
"bite-sized" chunks of data, as simplification usually does. </p>
    <p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a
 time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity
 is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather than the 
illumination of it.</p>
